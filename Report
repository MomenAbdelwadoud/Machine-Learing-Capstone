The introduction:
Ali is an investor in 2018, he wants to invest in calluses but he is so smart and cautious, he  has 3 choices: Coarse wool, Fine wool and cotton. He decided to find a data scientist to help him to predict the price of the three materials so he invests in the best selling material and gain a bigger amount of money.

The data:
The data is from Kaggle website it was uploaded by Michael Scott, Agricultural Raw Material prices (1990-2020), i only took the calluses data from it and calculated the Prices through 10 years from 2007 to 2017 to avoid the missing data problem (90% missing after 2017) and also data before that time will be meaningless.

Methodology:
I used fbProphet library to predict the price for the tree materials for 2 years till 31 may 2020 and visualized the data before and after prediction.

The Result:
Ive found that the highest Price is Fine wool price and it is 1212.75 $ , then cotton and it was 1070.37 $ and coarse wool was 1003.31 $.

The conclusion:
for everyone who wants to invest in calluses i recommend fine wool because it has the highest price.
